# A-Detection-Tool-for-Traffic-Objects

This is a web-based tool to do object detection on traffic objects. The system allows users to upload images and videos and then detects traffic objects, such as cars, trucks, traffic lights, pedestrians, bickers and stop signs. Our machine learning model using YOLOv3 algorithm will process images and videos and return results with the category and location of all detected objects.

The environment configuration is in xadmin/requirements.txt.

Here is the download link for the detecting weight. You should download it and put it in xadmin/demo_app/app/model_data.
